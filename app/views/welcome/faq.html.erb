            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <h4>Do you do the inspections yourself?</h4>

              <h4>What if I want to use a different warranty vendor?</h4>
              <p>Your OpenReal home comes with a free 2-year extended coverage warranty from OneGuard Home Warranties to reduce the risk and headaches associated with major home repairs. This warranty is made possible by an exclusive arrangement with OneGuard. If you prefer another home warranty company, we are happy to provide one-year standard coverage from an alternate provider at your request.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>What is covered by the home warranty?</h4>
              <p>Prior to OpenReal purchasing the OneGuard home warranty on your behalf, you will have the opportunity to review the detailed terms, conditions, and coverage scope, which will be contained in your home warranty contract between you & OneGuard.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <h4>Can I work with Opendoor if I already have an agent?</h4>
              <p>You do not need an agent to sell your home to Opendoor, however, you are welcome to work with an agent and we can communicate directly with them if you prefer.

                If you are working with a real estate agent, you will need pay them a listing commission, usually between 1-3%.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Can I negotiate when I sell to Opendoor?</h4>
                <p>We focus on accuracy, not negotiation. Removing the hassle of negotiating is part of how we've simplified the process of selling your home. Our goal is to get you a market value offer on your home, which is why we ask you a lot of questions about your home before giving you an offer.

                  If you still feel like you have more information about your home you would like us to consider, including photos of its current condition, send them our way! We would be happy to learn more about your home so we can make you the most accurate offer. Additionally, if you feel like you received an offer from us that was below market value, please tell us! We want to make sure didn't miss something, and we'd be more than happy to share our process with you on how we came up with your offer.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>How does Opendoor come up with my offer price?</h4>
                  <p>We take pride in our method for accurately valuing homes. Our proprietary model was built by our in-house team of expert statisticians and real estate professionals. It uses all recent real estate transactions (i.e. comps in your neighborhood) to come up with an offer price. Our valuations team then takes a look at the information you gave us on your home and photos of your house to incorporate qualitative details to come up with your final offer price.

                    If our valuations team feels like additional information is needed in order to accurately value your home, we’ll reach out for more details. Photos are particularly valuable to our team, so if we don't have photos of your home from its last listing, we'll ask you to send us some. No matter what, your home valuation and offer from us is always free!</p>

                  <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <h4>What does OpenReal do with my home after buying it?</h4>
                    <p>After we purchase your home, we develop a repair and renovation plan. We make investments such as landscaping, painting, replacing countertops and floors and whatever else is needed to get the home in great condition for sale. Once the house is ready, we put it on the market. While a house is listed on the market, we keep it show-ready. We then go through the same wait and uncertainty that we help sellers avoid!

                    <h4>Is OpenReal a house flipper?</h4>
                    <p>We buy homes directly and renovate them for the buyer, but we are not the stereotypical flipper you might see on TV. Flippers typically look for undervalued homes sold in desperate circumstances, and aim for a minimum return of 25% on their purchase. In contrast, we look for fairly valued homes in good condition, and don't try to make large profit margins on the homes we buy and sell.

                      The way real estate is sold hasn’t changed much in over 100 years, but technology has made it possible to create an experience that’s 1,000 times better. We’re trying to reinvent how real estate works by making it as easy as possible to sell and buy a home.</p>
                      <br>
                      <h4>I am a real estate agent. Can I work with OpenReal?</h4>
                      <p>Yes. As a reliable buyer, we’ve helped many real estate agents provide value to their clients. You can request an offer by entering the home’s address on the homepage, answering some questions about it, and then you can show the offer to your client.

                        We charge the same amount whether or not a homeowner is working with a real estate agent. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to speak with us!</p>
